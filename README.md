## Features

### Batch Processing

- **Loudness Normalization** — ITU-R BS.1770-4 two-pass analysis with configurable Integrated Loudness (LUFS), True Peak (dBFS), and Loudness Range (LU)
- **5 Normalization Presets** — Defaults, Dialogue, Music, Broadcast, and Cinema — each with tuned I/TP/LRA targets; Advanced mode exposes manual sliders for fine-grained control
- **Volume Boost / Reduce** — Percentage-based amplifier applied to all audio streams; preserves channel layout and sample rate
- **Format Conversion** — Configurable video codec, audio codec, bitrate, resolution, and framerate; stream-copy or full re-encode modes
- **24 Conversion Presets** — General (MP4 H.264, MKV HEVC, WebM VP9, MP3 320k, FLAC), Web/Social (Discord 25 MB, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter/X, 720p Web), Devices (Apple, Android, Chromecast), Production (AV1, ProRes, FFV1, 4K Archive, MPEG-2), and Audio Only (WAV 16/24-bit, ALAC, M4A AAC, Opus, AC3 Surround) — with codec/container conflict detection
- **Audio Extraction** — Demux audio from video into MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG, Opus, or M4A with configurable bitrate, sample rate, and channel layout
- **Video & Audio Compression** — CRF-based encoding with 4 codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC, VP9, AV1), 4 quality presets (lossless / high / medium / low), per-codec speed presets (veryslow → veryfast), and optional target-size bitrate limiting; audio-only files compress to AAC (lossy) or FLAC (lossless)
- **Per-file Operations** — Each file in the queue can have a different operation and options; mixed-operation batches process in a single run
- **Concurrent Workers** — Configurable worker pool with mid-batch pause, resume, and cancellation
- **Real-time Progress** — Per-task speed, ETA, and progress bar with desktop notifications on completion
- **35+ Formats** — 21 video extensions (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WebM, TS…) and 14 audio extensions (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, Opus…)
- **Subtitle & Metadata Preservation** — Optionally copy subtitle streams, tags, chapters, and metadata to output
- **Input Validation** — File existence checks, operation validation, boost range clamping, and zero-byte output detection with automatic cleanup

### Media Editor

- **NLE Timeline** — Multi-track non-linear editor with V1/A1 tracks, source bin, drag-to-timeline, and frame-accurate editing
- **7 Edit Types** — Insert, Overwrite, Replace, Ripple Overwrite, Place on Top, Append, and Fit to Fill
- **4 Trim Types** — Roll, Ripple, Slip, and Slide with context-sensitive cursor near edit points
- **Trim & Cut** — In/out point editing with two modes: fast (stream-copy, keyframe-aligned) or precise (re-encode, frame-accurate)
- **Split Clip** — Split at playhead position, split at in/out selection boundaries, or clip-to-selection to trim a clip down to the selected region
- **Merge / Concatenate** — Combine 2+ trimmed segments into a single file via FFmpeg concat demuxer (fast) or filter_complex (precise)
- **Spatial Compositing** — Per-clip transforms with position (X/Y), scale (uniform lock), rotation, anchor point, and opacity; interactive canvas preview composites all video layers in real time
- **Transform Gizmos** — Drag-to-move, corner/edge scale handles (Shift = uniform), rotation handle with 15° snap, and anchor adjustment — all with affine matrix hit-testing on rotated bounding boxes
- **Keyframe Animation** — Add/remove keyframes per transform property with 4 easing functions (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out), angle shortest-path interpolation, and binary search keyframe lookup
- **8 Blend Modes** — Normal, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, Darken, Lighten, Add, and Difference — applied in both canvas preview and FFmpeg export
- **Transform Inspector** — Numeric inputs for all spatial properties with drag-to-scrub, keyframe toggle buttons (◆), uniform scale lock, and blend mode dropdown
- **Replace Audio Track (A2)** — Swap a video's audio with another file while preserving the video stream; inline trim handles on the A2 timeline track with per-track volume and mute controls; drag A2 between clips
- **GIF Export** — Two-pass palette generation for high-quality GIFs with configurable loop, FPS (1-30), and width
- **Remux** — Losslessly keep/drop individual streams, edit metadata tags, and set per-stream disposition flags (default, dub, original, comment, lyrics, karaoke, forced, hearing/visual impaired)
- **Stream Inspector** — Detailed FFprobe viewer with container info, per-stream codec/resolution/channels/sample rate, and metadata editor
- **Snap System** — Snap-to-edges during drag/trim operations with toggleable snap indicator
- **Undo / Redo** — 50-level history stack for all clip, trim, split, transform, and keyframe operations
- **Per-clip Controls** — Independent volume slider, mute toggle, speed adjustment, and spatial transform per clip
- **Playback Controls** — Volume slider, speed selector (0.25x-2x), and keyboard shortcuts (Space, I, O, R, arrows, J/K/L transport)
- **Drag-to-reorder** — Visual multi-clip track lane with proportional clip blocks, audio replacement badges, and drag-and-drop sequencing
- **Video & Waveform Preview** — Canvas 2D composited preview for multi-layer spatial transforms; native `<video>` for single-clip; canvas waveform for audio-only
- **FFmpeg Spatial Export** — Per-clip filter chains: scale → rotate → opacity → overlay positioning with animated keyframe expressions via `eval=frame`; blend mode support via FFmpeg blend filters
- **7 Output Formats** — Video: MP4, MKV, WebM, AVI, MOV, TS, GIF — Audio: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, Opus

- **Beat Detection** — Per-frame analysis across sub-bass, bass, low-mid, mid, high-mid, and treble bands with beat-reactive visuals
- **Audio Quality** — Best / Good / Low quality presets for YouTube stream selection
- **Playlist Features** — Drag-to-reorder, shuffle, repeat (off / all / one), now-playing indicator, auto-scroll to active track, folder browser with system shortcuts, auto-skip on consecutive failures
- **Transport Bar** — Custom seek bar with visual thumb and fill, play/pause, prev/next, shuffle, repeat, volume slider with mute toggle
- **Popout Player** — Always-on-top window with compact transport, pin/unpin, 3 size presets, custom size memory, state transfer, and auto-resume playback
- **URL Input & History** — Paste YouTube URLs or direct audio links; persisted history with title, track count, and date
- **Cookie Caching** — Transparent browser cookie export for authenticated YouTube content with auto-retry on auth failures

- **System Tray** — Icon with context menu (Show, Pop Out Player, Player, Editor, Batch, Logs, Quit), live batch progress in tooltip, and minimize-to-tray behavior
- **Auto-updater** — Check / download / install from GitHub Releases with progress forwarding and persistent update status from startup
